A general-purpose tree tensor network core library. DMFT/EDMFT impurity-solver workflows are provided by the companion `GraftImpurity.jl` package, which depends on Graft rather than being embedded in it.

The architecture is largely inspired by [PyTreeNet](https://github.com/Drachier/PyTreeNet), and its tensor network foundation is built on [TensorKit.jl](https://github.com/QuantumKitHub/TensorKit.jl), which lets us exploit the abelian and non-abelian symmetries. It is designed to flexibly adopt new algorithms from papers for experimentation and verification — i.e., tree *graft*ing.


## Quick example

```julia
using Graft, GraftTestUtils, Random
using Graft.Backend: ℂ

topo = star_topology(3, 2)                       # generic star geometry
S = spin_ops()
phys = Dict(nodeid(topo, i) => S.P for i in 1:nnodes(topo))

H = OpSum()
for (c, p) in Graft.Trees.edges(topo)
    H += Term(-1.0, SiteOp(nodeid(topo, c), :Z, S.Z), SiteOp(nodeid(topo, p), :Z, S.Z))
end
for i in 1:nnodes(topo)
    H += Term(-0.9, SiteOp(nodeid(topo, i), :X, S.X))
end
O = ttno_from_opsum(H, topo, phys; hermitian=true)

ψ = random_ttns(Xoshiro(1), ComplexF64, topo, phys, ℂ^2)
ψ, energies = dmrg2!(ψ, O; trunc=TruncationScheme(maxdim=32))

ev = TDVP1_CBE(
    cbe=PredictorCBE(max_add=16),
    trunc=TruncationScheme(maxdim=64),
)
evolve!(ev, ψ, O, -0.05im, 100)                  # real-time evolution, bond-adaptive
```

`TDVP1_CBE` accepts TDVP-only strategies: the projected-variance
`PredictorCBE()` default, `PredictorLegacyCBE()` for the former finite-step
predictor, `NaiveCBE(rng=...)` for explicit-RNG randomized selection, and the
strict chain-only `LGVDCBE()` implementation with factorized C2/C3 selection.
`TDVP1_GSE(ancillary_shift=...)` is the global Yang--White ancillary-Krylov
bootstrap; `TDVP1_LSE` retains the local effective-two-site expansion schedule.

## Tests

Use focused tests for the affected code by default. Run the full suite only for
broad or shared low-level changes; full acceptance uses four parallel shards.

```bash
# Focused test (replace with the affected test file)
julia --project=test --startup-file=no test/ttno_compression.jl

# Full acceptance: four shards in parallel
printf '%s\n' 1 2 3 4 | xargs -P4 -I{} env \
  GRAFT_TEST_SHARD_COUNT=4 GRAFT_TEST_SHARD_INDEX={} \
  JULIA_NUM_THREADS=1 OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS=1 \
  julia --project=test --startup-file=no test/runtests.jl
```

M1/M2 focused entrypoints:

```bash
julia --project=test --startup-file=no test/spectral.jl
julia --project=test --startup-file=no test/implicit_log_time.jl
julia --project=test --startup-file=no test/metts.jl
```

Impurity acceptance workflows (finite-mode Anderson-Holstein benchmarks,
Kondo scaling with the checked-in adapol bath artifact, Matsubara transforms,
and the CTSEG cross-check against committed reference data) live in the
companion [GraftImpurity.jl](https://github.com/GraftTN/GraftImpurity.jl)
package.

## Spectral and thermal analysis

`HankelDMD` (the matrix-pencil family), right-subspace `ESPRIT`,
`ARLeastSquares`/`linear_prediction`,
`DescendingRankSearch`, and `complex_time_krylov` provide the M1 spectral
post-processing layer. Scalar and array-valued exponential fits use explicit
rank, zero, channel-reduction, pruning, and mode policies; fit diagnostics are
kept separate from the pure `ExponentialSum` value. Complex-time Krylov accepts
either dense Gram matrices or TTNS snapshots plus a Hermitian TTNO.
`LeftSubspaceESPRIT` is an explicit time-major compatibility backend for
consumers with demonstrated noisy-parity requirements; it is not the default
`ESPRIT`.

The M2 layer includes deterministic purification, `METTS`, `HybridMETTS`,
and real-time purification with auxiliary `:backward`/custom evolution.

## Parallel runtime

When using Julia-level fan-out, launch Julia with one BLAS thread and configure
the Strided and TensorKit transformer backends once during process startup,
before starting solver or fan-out work:

```bash
JULIA_NUM_THREADS=24 OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS=1 julia --project=.
```

```julia
using Graft
configure_parallel_runtime!()  # BLAS = Strided = transformer = 1
```

This avoids nested backend threading inside each Graft task. TensorKit's
transformer pool applies only to graded/fusion-tree coordinate transforms;
TensorKit v0.17 sector-block `mul!` remains serial. Benchmark different backend
thread counts explicitly for workloads dominated by one large contraction or
coordinate transform; sector-rich workloads with many small blocks should keep
the three backend pools at one. On multi-socket hosts, choose thread count and
CPU affinity so work is balanced across NUMA domains. Thermal correlators and
dense thermal references keep fan-out off by default because each active item
retains its own state and environments; opt in with `threaded=true` after
budgeting that per-item memory.
They and RSVD probe generation accept `threaded`/`minbatch` or
`rsvd_threaded`/`rsvd_minbatch` controls for serial A/B runs and
workload-specific granularity.

Tier-3 one- and two-site TTNO channel slicing is experimental and remains off
by default. Large Krylov maps can opt in through `eff_h1`, `eff_h2`, the DMRG
drivers, or the TDVP evolvers, with an explicit contraction live-memory budget:

```julia
ev = TDVP1(threaded_channels=true, channel_slices=3,
           channel_min_flops=1_000_000,
           channel_memory_cap_bytes=2_000_000_000)
```

Solver/evolver entry points default `channel_min_flops` to `1_000_000`, so
small maps fall back before slice construction or memory-cap enforcement.
Direct `eff_h1`/`eff_h2` calls default the gate to zero to preserve explicit
opt-in behavior. The gate uses stored-sector FLOPs when the planner can model
them and otherwise falls back to the dense estimate. On the current 24-thread
star benchmarks, one-site maps cross break-even near χ=32 and reach about
1.25× at χ=64. Two-site maps use a cost model to choose between internal and
external TTNO edges; the 3×1 star is 0.63–0.67× at χ=16 but 1.22–1.53× at χ=64.
Keep BLAS, Strided, and TensorKit transformer pools at one thread when this
outer fan-out is active.

### MPI extension

MPI support is loaded only when MPI.jl is present in the application
environment. Construct one explicit context during process startup and pass it
to the operation that should be distributed; Graft does not consult a global
communicator:

```julia
using Graft, MPI

context = mpi_context() # COMM_WORLD; also sets all three backend pools to 1

ev = TDVP1(
    distributed=context,
    channel_slices=24,
    channel_min_flops=1_000_000,
    channel_memory_cap_bytes=2_000_000_000,
)
result = complex_time_krylov(snapshots, H; distributed=context)
```

`eff_h1` and `eff_h2` replicate the state, assign TTNO-channel slices across
ranks and Julia threads, and sum partial TensorMaps block by block. DMRG and
TDVP use a root-driven Krylov protocol: rank zero owns adaptive solver control,
while every matvec broadcasts its input and all ranks evaluate their assigned
channels. This avoids collective-order divergence when local floating-point
convergence decisions differ.

METTS and HybridMETTS distribute independent Markov chains:

```julia
trajectory = thermalize(
    METTS(; rng, nsamples=600), problem, beta;
    evolver, distributed=context,
)
checkpoint!(trajectory, "metts-mpi.jld2")
trajectory = resume_mpi("metts-mpi.jld2", context).state
```

The global sample count must provide at least one sample per rank. RNG streams
are deterministically separated by rank. Checkpoints contain one atomic shard
per rank plus a root-written manifest that validates rank count, sample count,
and chain step before resume.

Launch Julia with the MPI implementation selected by MPI.jl and four Julia
threads per rank, for example:

```bash
mpiexecjl -n 6 julia --project=/path/to/app --threads=4 mpi_job.jl
```

The repository keeps functional, adaptive-solver, and performance checks
separate:

```bash
mpiexecjl -n 6 julia --project=/path/to/mpi-test-env --threads=4 test/mpi_smoke.jl
mpiexecjl -n 6 julia --project=/path/to/mpi-test-env --threads=4 test/mpi_solver_smoke.jl
mpiexecjl -n 6 julia --project=/path/to/mpi-test-env --threads=4 test/mpi_tdvp.jl
mpiexecjl -n 6 julia --project=/path/to/mpi-test-env --threads=4 test/mpi_speedup.jl
```

On the current 6-rank, 4-threads-per-rank test host, the warmed
ComplexTimeKrylov benchmark reports 0.274 s serial versus 0.059 s MPI, or
4.646x. `GRAFT_MPI_MIN_SPEEDUP`, `GRAFT_MPI_BENCH_SAMPLES`,
`GRAFT_MPI_BENCH_SNAPSHOTS`, and `GRAFT_MPI_BENCH_BOND_DIM` control the
acceptance workload.

The larger single-node SLURM benchmark in `benchmark/mpi_slurm_large.jl` uses
ten tree nodes, 36 snapshots, and bond dimension 12. On the `h3c` partition's
48-core `h10` node (job 71949), three warmed samples gave 2.70044 s with one
MPI rank and four BLAS threads versus 0.289441 s with 12 MPI ranks and four
BLAS threads per rank. This is a 9.3298x speedup and 77.75% parallel
efficiency. Both configurations produced identical overlap and Hamiltonian
norms, energy sums, retained rank, and maximum residual. Reproduce both
configurations in one exclusive-node allocation with:

```bash
sbatch benchmark/run_mpi_slurm_h3c.sh
```
